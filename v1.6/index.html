		<div class="battle section">
			<p>
				A player turn begins with the Battle Phase.<br>
				During the Battle Phase, each combat Unit can execute <b> up to 3</b> <a href="primary-actions">Primary Actions</a>.<br>
				Once the player has resolved a Unit's actions, lay the piece on its side to denote that it has completed its actions for the remainder of the turn.<br>
				Each Unit can only execute Actions once per turn.<br>
				Players may not execute Actions with more than one unit simultaneously.<br>
				At the end of the turn, reset all Units to their upright position.<br>
				Each Action must be unique. For example, a Unit may not attack three times in a row.<br>
				<b>Retreat:</b> One exception to the rule that each Action must be unique is Retreat. If a Unit's first Action is Movement, it's second Action is Attack or Seize/Destroy, then that Unit may execute another Movement for it's third Action.<br>

				<li>Town (value of 2)</li>

			</ol>
			<p>
				Buildings and new combat Units are built simply by paying their value in Gold and then placing according to the following rules:<br>
				Buildings must be placed on or adjacent to any of the player's Land or Sea Units.<br>
				Buildings follow an upgrade path: Villages may be built on empty hexes, Towns are built by upgrading an existing Village, and Castles must be Upgraded from a Town.<br>
				New Buildings can not be upgraded until the player's next turn.<br>
				Buildings can only be upgraded once per turn.<br>
				New Land units are placed on the same hex as their corresponding Buildings.<br>
				Soldiers can only be built in Villages.<br>
				Archers can only be built in Towns.<br>
				Knights can only be built in Castles.<br>
				Ships are placed on any sea hex adjacent to their corresponding coastal Building.<br>
				Ships can only be built by Villages.<br>
				Longships can only be built by Towns.<br>
				Galleons can only be built by Castles.<br>
				When placing new units players must respect <a href="#occupancy">maximum occupancy rule</a>.<br>

					Ranged attacks are blocked by mountains and walls but not opponent Units.<br>

				If defeated Units were carrying Gold or Victory Tokens, they are transferred to the victor's adjacent Units. If they were defeated at range, the Gold and Victory Tokens remain on the hex, and can be picked up by the first player who moves Units onto that hex.<br>
				<b>Sea Victory:</b> If the attacker wins a battle at sea, the victor sinks the loser's ships. Remove them from the board and place them in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard.<br>
				If the defeated Ships were carrying Gold or Victory Tokens, they are transferred to the victor's adjacent Units. If they were defeated at range, the Gold and Victory Tokens remain on the hex, and can be picked up by the first player who moves Units onto that hex.<br>
				<b>Sinking a Longship loaded with Units:</b> If a Longship loaded with Units is defeated in Naval battle, the victor captures all units aboard and sinks the Longship. However, if Archers are aboard, they must be defeated prior to sinking the Longship.<br>

				<ul>
					<li>The seizing Unit is located on or adjacent to the hex with the Building to be seized</li>
					<li>The Building to be seized is undefended</li>
				</ul>
				If the Building is defended, the attacking player must first defeat all defenders.<br>
				To seize a Building, a player removes it from the board and replaces it with an equivalent Building of their own color. He may then move the seizing unit onto the hex.<br>
				To destroy a Building, remove it from the board along with any Prisoners, Gold and Victory Tokens that were on the same hex.<br>
				<b>Rescue:</b> If a player seizes a Building with prisoners, all prisoners belonging to him are freed and can now be Activated. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the Building's new owner.<br>
				Players receive Victory Tokens equal to the value of all prisoners on the hex.<br>
				<b>Seizing Walls:</b> Any walls on hexes that are seized by an opponent also change ownership only if there are none of the original owner's Units on the other side of the wall. This is not an all or none condition. It is possible that some walls could be converted and others not.<br>
				Ships may seize coastal buildings.<br>

				Units may defend a Building if they are located on the same hex.<br>
