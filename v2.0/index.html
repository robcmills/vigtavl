				<p>Some Actions require a Target, which is the Unit or Location to which the Action applies. Players identify Targets in the same manner as Actors.</p>

					<b>Sea Victory:</b> If the attacker wins a battle at sea, the victor sinks the loser's ships. Remove them from the board and place them in an area near him designated as his ship graveyard.<br>

					To destroy a Building, remove it from the board along with any Prisoners, Gold and Victory Tokens that were on the same hex.<br>
					<b>Rescue:</b> If a player seizes a Building with prisoners, all prisoners belonging to him are freed and can now be Activated. Any prisoners belonging to other players become the prisoners of the Building's new owner.<br>

					<b>Seizing Walls:</b> Any walls on hexes that are seized by an opponent also change ownership only if there are none of the original owner's Units on the other side of the wall. This is not an all or none condition. It is possible that some walls could be converted and others not.<br>
